<p>What makes English the world&#8217;s most powerful language? Is it the way it sounds? The way it&#8217;s written? The sheer number of people who speak it? Read on to find out!</p>



<h2>Why did the world start speaking English?</h2>



<p>When discussing how to learn English in a simple, effective manner, I often hear people say something like: I’m never going to need it. I live in Brazil; Spanish is enough for me. While you might think that speaking Spanish will allow you to get by just fine, I’d argue that there are a couple of reasons why every single person should be learning English—even if they don’t plan on leaving their home country. The world has become an increasingly interconnected place, and with increased globalization comes increased opportunities. Even if you don’t see yourself ever traveling outside your home country or region, learning English opens up new career paths that would otherwise be closed off to non-English speakers. It also makes doing business easier, as many companies have a worldwide presence and knowing English allows you to work with clients from all over the world.</p>



<h2>What Makes a Language Universal?</h2>



<p>In a world of seven billion people, hundreds of spoken languages, and thousands of dead ones, English is becoming an increasingly important unifier. That may sound obvious—English is one of six official languages at United Nations headquarters in New York City—but it belies some seriously impressive numbers. According to SIL International, an estimated 400 million people speak some form of English as a second language; that’s about 1 in 10 people on Earth. By comparison, China only has an estimated 100 million native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. While that may be great for creating global understanding, it comes with its own problems; deciding how to speak or write proper English can often lead to arguments both within and across countries.</p>



<h2>Native Speakers Today</h2>



<p>How Did It Happen? There are around a billion people who speak English as their first language and roughly 3 billion people who speak it as a second language. These figures make English one of our planet’s most widely-spoken languages; but how did it become so dominant? The history of an international language is fascinating in its own right, but also offers valuable insights into how we communicate today. In particular, what can we learn about globalization from English’s meteoric rise to prominence? And how will English change over time?<br>English is no longer just a Western European language – these days, you’ll find speakers all over Asia, Africa and South America. This geographic spread isn’t surprising when you consider that 500 years ago, there were only 10 million native speakers of English worldwide! However, by 1750 there were 50 million native speakers (and another 50 million non-native ones), which means that by 1850 – just 100 years later – there were 100 million native speakers worldwide.</p>



<h2>How Many People Speak English as their First Language?</h2>



<p>As a result of colonization, there are hundreds of millions of people around the world who speak English as their first language. These nations include countries in North America and across Europe, Australia, and South Africa. There are also many former colonies that still use English to varying degrees, including India, Nigeria, Liberia, Malaysia and Pakistan. In total there are more than a billion people around the world who speak English as their native language.</p>



<h2>What are Some Confusing Points in the History of English?</h2>



<p>England was originally invaded by Germanic tribes who spoke Germanic languages. These were later replaced with Scandinavian invaders, most of whom also spoke Germanic languages, although some were (vaguely) related to Old Norse. Finally, Latin-speaking Normans from France conquered England in 1066 and ruled it for more than 300 years, bringing French with them but also learning English.</p>



<h2>Does Anyone Know What Spanglish Is, Anyway?</h2>



<p>We&#8217;d all like to think we know what words mean, but some are up for debate. Take Spanish. Is it a language? A dialect? An accent? Is it Spanish with an American twang or something else entirely? Spanglish has been evolving in America for more than 400 years, and experts still can&#8217;t agree on what defines it. Here&#8217;s how Spanglish made its way from Spain to our shores. How Much Money Do You Really Make?: Are you making enough money? How much do you really make at your job, after taxes and living expenses? What about your spouse or partner? Find out how much money you make—and how much you&#8217;re likely to make next year—with these simple tools that estimate how changes in income affect your tax burden and take into account government programs such as food stamps. This calculator helps determine whether those free services actually save you money each month.</p>



<h2>So…How Can You Learn To Speak It Like a Native Speaker?</h2>



<p>For those of you who are not native speakers, how can you learn to speak it like a native speaker? The best way is to immerse yourself in an English-speaking environment. This will force you to listen and speak only in English. Every time you speak or interact with another person, you&#8217;ll be exposed to grammar rules and new vocabulary. You&#8217;ll also start picking up on slang words that native speakers use all of the time. It won&#8217;t happen overnight, but if you put in enough hours and practice every day, you should be able to sound just as good as a native speaker within a few months&#8217; time.</p>

<p></p>



<p>It’s hard to believe that 15 years ago, Elon Musk didn’t even have one million dollars to his name. But today, the South African-born serial entrepreneur has a net worth of over 20 billion dollars and the founder of SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and Neuralink. How did he do it? You might be surprised to learn what Musk’s biggest strengths are as an entrepreneur and business leader.</p>



<h2>Tesla</h2>



<p>The idea for Tesla started with a hot tub. While vacationing in Ontario, Canada, at his friend’s cottage, Musk saw that all of his friend’s electricity was coming from a hydroelectric plant built by Nikola Tesla in 1895—the same year as Edison opened his first power plant. Musk wondered why no one had thought of connecting solar panels to batteries before and began researching how he could do it himself. He later told 60 Minutes: I came up with a design for a solar thermal energy system that I thought would be low cost and simple and easy to install…and then I worked on figuring out what would be a good market for it. And I thought, well, we need something where there’s lots of sunlight and not much air pollution.</p>



<h2>SpaceX</h2>



<p>The goal of SpaceX is both ambitious and grounded in reality. If we can send a vehicle into space and return it safely to Earth, then commercial space travel—and ultimately colonization of other planets—becomes possible. And that means taking humanity off planet. It’s a huge ambition but with proper planning and execution, it’s not as crazy as it sounds.</p>



<h2>SolarCity</h2>



<p>When Elon Musk started SolarCity in 2006, he never expected it would become a multi-billion dollar company. Back then, solar energy was just becoming popular, and few people were aware of its benefits or how much it would cost. To figure out how much investment would be needed to launch a massive-scale project, he called his cousin Lyndon Rive (one of SolarCity’s co-founders) and asked him how much money they could raise if they sold their shares at $10 each. The answer? Approximately $80 million—but that’s only if everyone invested.</p>



<h2>Hyperloop</h2>



<p>In 2012, a white paper written by Musk became popular. In it, he described a new form of high-speed transportation that would travel faster than supersonic jets. He called it the fifth mode of transportation &#8212; after planes, trains, cars and boats &#8212; that would carry passengers in pressurized tubes at near-supersonic speeds. Unlike trains or cars, Hyperloop capsules traveling between distant cities wouldn&#8217;t need to stop for hours at a time while they load and unload passengers and cargo. The whole idea came together under an umbrella concept: Hyperloop.</p>



<h2>OpenAI</h2>



<p>The nonprofit artificial intelligence research company OpenAI, launched by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, is hiring. The San Francisco-based team focuses on developing AI that benefits humanity as a whole, instead of helping a specific business or creating weapons. According to its site, Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate a financial return. While few companies have made major strides in improving AIs over time (Google&#8217;s DeepMind being one), OpenAI has some big backers (and brains) behind it.</p>



<h2>Neuralink</h2>



<p>Why the risks are worth it<br>Entrepreneurs often take risks when they start a business. There’s risk in starting a company, whether it’s driven by passion or profit, and for some of us, it may seem like there’s an endless supply of ways our businesses could fail. When these fears loom large, it can be difficult to know if we should push forward with our idea or cut our losses. But what many entrepreneurs forget is that failure is inevitable—there are a lot of things that could go wrong. That said, even those who fail don’t give up on their entrepreneurial dreams: According to Small Business Trends research, 70 percent of people who started businesses felt more confident in their decision after they had failed.</p>



<p><br>Elon Musk has long been fascinated with artificial intelligence and how it might change humanity. He says that AI will not just be a mix of human intelligence and machine intelligence, but it will ultimately take on a life of its own. To that end, he launched Neuralink, which aims to connect your brain directly to digital devices like computers. His belief is that in order for humans and AI to work together we must merge with machines &#8212; if we don&#8217;t do so willingly, he believes our own evolution as a species could force us into it against our will. One way or another, he wants humans and machines to become one.</p>



<h2>The financial services sector has more competition</h2>



<p>Musk could have gotten his degree in physics, joined a big company, and lived happily ever after. But he didn’t. He took a chance on PayPal because he thought there was more opportunity in financial services than rocketry. That might seem obvious now, but back then it was a much riskier idea — so risky that eBay beat him out by acquiring PayPal for $1.5 billion while he was still at school.</p>



<h2>Raising Capital is becoming more difficult</h2>



<p>The good news is that raising capital is getting easier. The bad news? Raising capital is becoming more difficult. A decade ago, it took startups an average of 24 months to raise their first significant round of venture funding. Today, it takes more than three years. While total funding has grown by 30% during that time, rounds have shrunk by 20%. This means you will likely have to work harder and smarter than ever before if you want your business startup business gets funded.</p>



<h2>What he would have done differently</h2>



<p>It’s hard to say with certainty what Musk would have done differently in his younger days, but there’s at least one thing he has mentioned since becoming a billionaire: I was really sad when I realized I wouldn’t become a superhero. When I was a kid, superheroes were my idols. It would be great if we could create some kind of fast transportation system—you know, go anywhere on Earth in under an hour. That would be fantastic. The only way to do that would be to have an orbital vehicle…and re-enter from orbit. These things sound far out, but they’re really not that crazy anymore…the technology is more or less there.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In March of 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished from radar shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing. The plane and the 239 people on board have never been found, and no one knows what exactly happened to them or where they ended up — it’s truly aviation’s biggest mystery. Below are five possible theories about what happened to the plane, along with their likelihood and the most compelling evidence (or lack thereof) to support each one.<a href="http://www.dekorbiz.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 departed from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia en route to Beijing. The plane carried 227 passengers and 12 crew members, who were from more than 14 countries. It flew normally for about an hour and a half before it disappeared from air traffic control radar over Vietnam. When it didn’t land as scheduled in Beijing four hours later, authorities around Asia and then the world launched a search operation that remains ongoing two years later. However, debris has been spotted throughout Southeast Asia since then. Authorities have not confirmed whether any of it is from Flight 370. A Chinese ship detected signals consistent with those emitted by underwater locator beacons attached to aircraft on April 5 and April 8; however, no wreckage was found in either location. In July 2015, a flaperon washed up on Reunion Island off Africa’s east coast. French officials confirmed that it was part of Flight 370 based on unique identifiers like its color and markings. Investigators still don&#8217;t know what happened to Flight 370 or where exactly it crashed into the ocean—if indeed it did crash at all—but they do have some theories based on what they&#8217;ve found so far…</p>



<h2>The facts about Malaysia Airlines flight 370</h2>



<ol><li>Malaysia Airlines flight 370 was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Malaysian Airlines between Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport. 2. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, serial number 28420, registration 9M-MRO, is owned by Malaysia Airlines (Malaysia). 3. The first routine contact with air traffic control occurred while on a cruise flight at FL350 (35,000 feet), approximately one hour before the anticipated landing [in Beijing]. There were no distress calls from either <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/bill-gates/">pilot during or after other routine</a> communications with air traffic control. 4.</li></ol>



<h2>Explanation about Boeing 777</h2>



<p>The Boeing 777 is a long-range, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is designed to be operated as a complete airline flight, and often operates on long-haul intercontinental routes between major cities of the world. Along with Airbus&#8217; A330 and A340, it was one of only three types widely used around the world until very recently. The aircraft has two engine types; Rolls Royce Trent 800s for most models and General Electric GE90 for some models (all aircraft). It has been offered in two main variants: -200ER/300ER (Extended Range) and -300/400 ER (Extended Range).</p>



<h2>Questions asked by everyone on the MH370 accident</h2>



<p>What happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777-200ER flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China? The aircraft disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board and has yet to be found. Several theories have arisen about what happened; some believe it crashed into the sea near Australia, while others think it landed on an unknown island. There&#8217;s even a theory that its fuselage could have been used for target practice by North Korea. And then there are those who don&#8217;t believe there ever was a missing plane in the first place. However, new reports suggest that MH370 may have landed safely and is waiting to be repaired somewhere—leaving behind passengers who were not supposed to survive.</p>



<h2>Conclusion on the MH370 incident</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s been more than four years since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board, but still no answers. The Boeing 777 was supposed to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m. on March 8, 2014, but never arrived—and no trace of it has ever been found. Authorities have confirmed that they believe flight 370 crashed into the Indian Ocean; however, what caused that crash remains unknown. Here are some of the explanations on the MH370 incident that you may have heard over and over again—and why experts think these theories just don&#8217;t add up.</p>

<h2>intro</h2>



<p>Bill Gates&#8217; success and wealth as the richest man in the world are well known, but there&#8217;s one thing that most people don&#8217;t know about his rise to riches and Microsoft&#8217;s growth under his leadership; he quit college to start Microsoft. He was just 18 years old when he made this decision, and he had little money to speak of at the time, so why did he do it? If you&#8217;re interested in how Bill Gates became the richest man in the world, then you need to read on to learn his secret formula for success &#8211; <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/the-top-10-maritime-attorneys-in-houston-you-need-to-know/">it can change your life too!</a></p>



<h2>From rags to riches</h2>



<p>From 1965 to the present day, Microsoft has seen phenomenal growth. It all started with one man: Bill Gates. Little did we know, he had a dark secret that helped him become who he is today. Check out what made him what he is today and how you can apply it to your own life. He says there are three things you need to do if you want to become successful. These are no guarantees but they certainly give us something to think about. He says he never knew where his next meal was coming from or when his next paycheck would be coming in. So here’s his advice for anyone looking for success. Let’s begin…<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</h2>



<p>Not many people know that in 1985, when Bill Gates left Microsoft, he and his wife Melinda created The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. It was a non-profit organization aiming to help children worldwide with improving health and learning. Since then, they have awarded more than $30 billion to various initiatives. What most people don’t know is why they chose to get involved with philanthropy in such a large way. Most billionaires would either give away their money quietly or would set up their own charitable foundations through family members or close friends. But not Bill and Melinda; instead, they decided to give it all away through an entirely separate entity from themselves &#8211; The Gates Foundation. This is where things get interesting…</p>



<h2>Do you have what it takes?</h2>



<p>In August 2010, Forbes declared that Bill Gates was once again, for the seventh consecutive year, the richest man in the world. The magazine also reported that he was worth $59 billion. So you might wonder: What&#8217;s his secret? What does it take to become one of the wealthiest men in modern history? Surely you are aware that only a very small percentage (like 0.001%) of people ever manage to become millionaires at all—and even fewer go on to earn billions. So how did Gates do it? And what can we learn from him? Well, if you want to become one of the wealthiest men in modern history yourself, here is your chance…to discover THE DARK SECRET OF BILL GATES! This is not some kind of joke; I am dead serious! You see, while most gurus like to keep their secrets close and sell them for big bucks over and over again—I have decided to give mine away for free. Just follow my simple instructions below and soon enough you will be able to say: I am Bill Gates!<br>I know what you&#8217;re thinking…what makes me so sure that I can help YOU become as rich as Bill Gates? Well, let me tell you something about myself first.</p>



<h2>Why did he do it?</h2>



<p>By setting aside his ego, by building a team around him, and by admitting mistakes. To become The World&#8217;s Richest Man you need to have 3 things: a clear understanding that there are no limits, being positive in all situations and not being afraid to lose everything you have. When he started Microsoft he was already worth $1 million but risked it all when starting Microsoft with just one product. When they released Windows 1.0 he was almost bankrupt but then came Windows 2.0 and then Windows 3.0 which made them billionaires overnight! He knew that if he wanted to become The World&#8217;s Richest Man, he had to focus on his vision and be confident about it because most people would say it is impossible. His advice for becoming The World&#8217;s Richest Man is Be passionate about what you do. And remember: If your dreams don&#8217;t scare you, they&#8217;re not big enough!</p>



<h2>What is his secret?</h2>



<p>Bill Gates has a secret you need to learn. He, along with countless others, will tell you it is all about hard work and sacrifice. And while that may be true to some extent, there is something more fundamental that is at play here: they took risks and made sacrifices based on calculated actions. What are we talking about? Something as simple as learning when to quit and walk away from something seemingly good in order to accept something better or different down the road. This can apply to people who go back for their second undergraduate degree versus those who start a new business after leaving full-time employment for a startup or established business venture. It can also apply to someone like Bill Gates, who left Harvard University early to pursue his dream of starting Microsoft. He was willing to give up his reputation as an honor student and leave behind his friends because he had a vision that would later become one of the largest companies in history.

<h2>What is Financial Performance</h2>



<p>The overall financial performance incorporates all revenue, costs, and expenses for a period. The three main financial statements include an income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Quarterly reports are also issued to give investors an in-depth look at how a company is doing and what its future outlook may be. A good way to measure overall financial performance is through profitability ratios such as return on equity (ROE) or return on assets (ROA). These ratios provide insight into how well a company manages its resources and whether it’s able to generate enough profit <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/worlds-first-flying-car-invented-in-slovakia-how-does-it-work/">from those resources.</a></p>



<h2>What are costs, Income and Important Ratios</h2>



<p>Some important ratios that entrepreneurs should track are gross margin, operating margin, return on invested capital (ROIC), and cash flow. Gross profit is an indication of how much money a company makes from selling goods and services to customers. Net profit is what’s left over after all expenses have been paid—or, in other words, net income. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) measures how profitable a company is before it even considers interest payments or tax bills<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">.for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>Gross Margin</h2>



<p>The gross margin is one of, if not THE most important numbers for any publicly-traded company. Essentially, it’s a snapshot of how much money is left over from revenue after all expenses are paid out. It helps investors understand how healthy a company’s business really is in comparison to its competitors and gives insight into how sustainable a company’s earnings may be in relation to its stock price.</p>



<h2>EBIT (Earnings Before Interest &amp; Tax)</h2>



<p>When a company reports earnings per share (EPS), it also reports EBIT or earnings before interest and tax. Like EPS, EBIT is reported on a per-share basis. However, it does not take into account interest expenses and taxes, which EPS does. Often times these two line items are added back to give investors a better picture of how much money an organization actually earned in a given year. In other words, EBIT is essentially an adjusted EPS number. For example, if a company has $100 million in revenue and $50 million in net income but $10 million in interest expense and $5 million in income tax, its adjusted net income would be calculated as follows: ($100M – $10M – $5M) / 10M = 10% operating margin.</p>



<h2>Net Profit Margin Section: Equity Profit Margin</h2>



<p>If you look at a company’s annual income statement, you can usually find a line called net income. This line item is equal to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) because net income – EBIT = profits. When calculating profit margin, we subtract out net interest expense from both sides of that equation to get: earnings before tax (EBT) – debit expenses = profit margin. Next, we divide that number by sales to arrive at our final margin figure.</p>



<h2>Return on Assets (ROA)</h2>



<p>The Return on Assets (ROA) formula is a profitability ratio that measures a company&#8217;s profitability relative to its total assets. ROA helps investors in determining how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings. To calculate return on assets, subtract total liabilities from a company&#8217;s net income and divide by total assets. A higher number means that a company is earning more profit for each dollar of assets. Investors can use ROA to compare companies within an industry or across different industries. A high return on assets indicates that a company is able to earn profits despite having few tangible assets or large amounts of intangible assets.</p>



<h2>Return on Equity (ROE) Section: Quick Ratio/Acid Test Ratio</h2>



<p>Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure that shows how much profit a company makes in comparison to shareholder’s equity. To calculate ROE, you divide income available to common stockholders by book value. The quick ratio or acid test ratio is a liquidity ratio used to assess whether a business has enough cash or easily convertible assets to meet its short-term obligations. The formula for calculating it is: Quick Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Marketable Securities)/Current Liabilities.</p>

<h2>intro</h2>



<p>The World’s First Flying Car was invented in Slovakia! How does it work? Slovakia has become the latest country to join the race to produce the world’s first flying car, with Aeromobil unveiling the prototype of its model at the Top Marques auto show in Monaco last week.</p>



<h2>Why flying cars are ideal for busy city dwellers</h2>



<p>Flying cars have been touted as a potential solution to urban congestion, and as we spend more time in cities, there are many good reasons why flying cars could be an attractive option. The world’s first flying car is set to take off soon—but how does it actually work? And why are flying cars an ideal solution for busy city dwellers? Read on to find out… As futuristic as they sound, flying cars are already taking off—literally. Slovakian company AeroMobil has just announced that it will launch its first model next year. But what exactly do these vehicles look like? And <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/worlds-first-flying-car-invented-in-slovakia-how-does-it-work/">how do they actually fly?</a> Let’s take a closer look at what makes them tick…</p>



<h2>Controlling the flying car</h2>



<p>The flying car will be controlled using an advanced version of your mobile phone. The flying car will fly based on its GPS coordinates, but if you want to take a tour around your city or town then all you need to do is turn on geofencing and you can restrict where your flying car can go. Your GPS coordinates are linked with Google Maps so that you always know where you are and where you’re going.f<a href="http://www.dekorbiz.com">or more info read</a></p>



<h2>Reducing traffic on roads with flying cars</h2>



<p>The two-seater flying car could be used to ease traffic, as there will no longer be any congestion on roads. We can see people switching their old cars for these new vehicles and use them whenever they need to travel long distances. Instead of being stuck in traffic jams or waiting for trains or buses, they can simply fly over using their new cars. This would not only reduce pollution levels but also save a lot of time.</p>



<h2>When will we see flying cars taking off?</h2>



<p>It might sound crazy, but flying cars could be a reality soon. Slovak company AeroMobil have revealed their vehicle &#8211; and although there&#8217;s no scheduled release date yet, people are already eagerly anticipating getting behind the wheel. The car is called an &#8216;Aeromobile&#8217; as it can drive on roads like any other car, before being converted into a plane for air travel. The firm say they&#8217;ve been working on it for 20 years and they hope to launch next year. But how will they do that? And what obstacles will they face along the way? We take a look at how AeroMobil plans to change our lives forever…</p>



<h2>Safety concerns about the flying car</h2>



<p>Before its planned release sometime next year, Slovakian company AeroMobil will likely have to make some adjustments. Namely, one model of their flying car lacks several safety features. For example, there are no airbags for both driver and passenger. This could be an issue with a vehicle that sits low to the ground and is exposed on all sides. Without any kind of protective barrier, even a minor accident could result in serious injury or death. The lack of seat belts may also pose problems; without them, passengers would need to hold onto something very tightly during takeoff and landing—something that might not be possible if they were carrying luggage or needed to brace themselves for turbulence.</p>



<h2>Does Slovakia have an advantage over others when it comes to inventing the first flying car?</h2>



<p>Other countries are scrambling to get their hands on flying cars, but one Central European country may beat them all to it: Slovakia. A couple of weeks ago, Slovakian company AeroMobil unveiled its latest futuristic invention – the car that can fly. Whether you live in California or Austria, you might be familiar with Uber. It’s an app that lets you book a ride in someone else’s car with just one tap of your smartphone. The company has been testing out self-driving cars for some time now and is even planning to launch a fleet of driverless taxis. But now there’s another contender for the world’s first flying car – and it comes from Slovakia. Dubbed the world’s first real flying car, AeroMobil 3.0 was revealed at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona last week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Social media has grown in popularity dramatically over the past decade, but how does it affect our brains and well-being? A new study suggests that the addictiveness of social media may be due to its effects on dopamine, which controls the brain’s reward and pleasure centers. This has huge implications not only on social media use but also on other addictions that target the same areas of the brain. Take this into consideration when you’re wondering why you can’t stop checking Facebook even though you know it makes you <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/worlds-first-flying-car-invented-in-slovakia-how-does-it-work/">feel bad about yourself!</a></p>



<h2>The science behind addiction</h2>



<p>Neuroscience has shown that addiction is actually a change in brain chemistry—and not simply a behavioral problem. Simply put, addiction hijacks our brains, compelling us to seek out certain experiences and ignore consequences. Scientists have pinpointed two parts of our brain involved in substance abuse: The limbic system and frontal cortex. The limbic system dictates our emotions and pleasure-reward responses; it makes us crave for certain experiences and gives us pleasure when we engage in them. Meanwhile, the frontal cortex allows us to make good decisions by filtering what’s good from what’s bad—to be rational, logical thinkers.<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>9 Signs You Are Addicted To Social Media</h2>



<p>You check social media first thing in the morning. When it’s time for you to stop using social media, you feel restless and uncomfortable until you start using it again. You spend much more time on social media than originally intended. You like certain types of content on social media more than others, and if there is no content that suits your taste, you feel agitated or uncomfortable. You have repeatedly tried to reduce your usage of or quit using social media without success.</p>



<h2>Tips To Break The Habit</h2>



<p>If you’re concerned about how much time you spend on social media, we’ve got a few tips to help you break your bad habits and form healthy ones. But first, ask yourself why you use social media so much. What are you getting out of it? Do other areas of your life feel lacking because of it? If so, we recommend talking to a therapist or counselor who can help facilitate conversation about your social media use and its effects on relationships with friends and family members.</p>



<h2>Plugging back into reality</h2>



<p>People who use social media several times a day can become addicted, just like drug addicts. So what is it about our brains that makes us vulnerable to these addictions? The brain’s reward system plays an important role in addiction and compulsive behavior. When we do something pleasurable—whether it’s eating chocolate or using Facebook—our brain releases dopamine, which helps control feelings of pleasure and motivation. The more we repeat an activity (eating chocolate or checking Facebook), the more dopamine gets released and attaches itself to neurons in our brain’s reward system, creating a strong desire for more of that experience.</p>



<h2>Infographic on stats of social media use/addiction</h2>



<p>The scary thing about Facebook is how much people use it. The average user spends almost an hour on Facebook every day (Ventura, 2011). Studies have also shown that people check their Facebook statuses up to 14 times a day (Ventura, 2011). When you think about how many hours in a day and multiply that by how many times someone checks their status, you can see why addiction is a problem. I think everyone at least knows one person who has become obsessed with checking their status.</p>



<p>6 Tips on Using Your Phone Less<br>According to a 2011 report from The Nielsen Company, more than half of Americans own a smartphone and check it regularly throughout their day. That’s 3 billion texts, 400 million tweets, 100 million photos, and 4 million hours of video uploaded each month. For many people, social media use has become an addiction that can be hard to break.</p>



<h2>10 Ways To Take A Digital Detox</h2>



<p>We live in a digital world where it’s nearly impossible to completely escape from technology. That being said, it is possible to take a break from our devices and learn how to enjoy life again. Here are 10 ways you can digitally detox and feel better about yourself. 1. Unplug your electronics for at least an hour every day 2. Have dinner without looking at your phone 3. Set limits on how long you spend on social media 4. Turn off all notifications 5. Don’t bring your phone into bed 6. Go for a walk outside 7. Use an app to track how much time you spend on your phone 8. Stop watching TV 9. Do one thing at a time 10. Avoid constant news updates</p>

<p>The Titanic was the most luxurious passenger liner to ever set sail across the North Atlantic. It also turned out to be one of the most tragic events in maritime history, when it sank during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City on April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg in the early hours of that morning. More than 1,500 passengers and crew were killed with only 705 surviving the accident, many of them picked up by the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia, which was just a few miles away when the Titanic went down at <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/worlds-first-flying-car-invented-in-slovakia-how-does-it-work/">approximately 2:20 AM local time.</a></p>



<h2>Top 3 things that contributed to the sinking</h2>



<p>The official inquiry into how and why RMS Titanic sank on 15 April 1912 produced a 692-page report but failed to pinpoint exactly what happened in those final hours. Nevertheless, it offers a number of possible causes for its sinking. The following are just three of them. Remember that when it left Southampton it was fully loaded with more than 3,000 tons of coal. When it was fitted out as a luxury liner after leaving Belfast, eight tons more were added – which would make her top-heavy – and she also carried water in two 11m-high tanks forward to provide extra ballast aft. If they had ever been used, they would have increased her gross tonnage from 46,328 tons to 49,928.<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>Why was there only limited damage done to other ships?</h2>



<p>There were other ships nearby when the Titanic sank, but none sustained major damage. In fact, there was little evidence that any ship in proximity to TITANIC actually collided with her. The immediate answer as to why that happened is simply good luck. If they had been sucked into TITANIC’s vortex, there would have been more damage and it’s likely more people would have died. But why didn’t those near-misses collide with TITANIC? It all comes down to physics. When a massive object like a cruise liner sinks quickly in water, it creates a suction force known as the vacuum effect. This force can be powerful enough to suck even large objects underwater if they are close enough. That explains how RMS Olympic managed to escape TITANIC’s pull; she was too far away for it to reach her hull. But what about other vessels that were closer than Olympic—how did they manage not get pulled under by suction force?</p>



<h2>The disappearance</h2>



<p>On April 15, 1912, at around 11 pm. ship time, RMS Titanic hit an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later. The great ship had been sailing from Southampton to New York when it struck an iceberg on its starboard side (right side) about 1250 miles away from Newfoundland. Two-thirds of those aboard perished in one of history’s worst maritime disasters. So what happened? Why did Titanic sink so quickly? And why did so many people die that night in April 1912? This is a look at some of these questions.</p>



<h2>The myth of J. Bruce Ismay</h2>



<p>It was May 8, 1912, and J. Bruce Ismay had been on board his ship, RMS Titanic, for less than three hours. Since dawn that morning he had been supervising operations in the Belfast shipyard where the Titanic was being fitted out prior to her maiden voyage. She was due to set sail on May 10 and head out into a four-day journey across one of the busiest shipping lanes in Europe before reaching Cherbourg, France, and then onto Southampton by 5 pm on Wednesday 15th May 1912. After five days at sea, she would begin her transatlantic crossing from Southampton to New York which started with an intended stop at Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland on Wednesday 22nd May 1912.</p>



<h2>The myth of Thomas Andrews</h2>



<p>Thomas Andrews was not a great man. He was not even a good man. Instead, he was what most young men were in 1913, a bit full of himself and eager to make his mark on history. The story that’s told is that he designed an unsinkable ship—the Titanic—and that its sinking remains a mystery to him (he went down with it). But if you take an honest look at what we know about his final days, you’ll find that nothing could be further from reality…</p>



<h2>The myth about iceberg warnings</h2>



<p>If a ship as massive as The Titanic could sink in mere hours, how did its crew fail to spot icebergs and avoid them? Well, it’s not that simple. There are several myths associated with those warnings, so let’s dive right into them. For starters, it was widely believed that when Captain Smith spotted an iceberg around 11 pm on April 14th, he relayed its position to his crew using radio and ordered them to turn left at full speed. That turned out to be incorrect – there were no working distress calls made from The Titanic that night.</p>

<h2>intro</h2>



<p>What if I told you that you could get $25-$50 worth of free cryptocurrency from complete strangers just by doing things you were going to do anyway? That’s exactly what happens when you take advantage of Binance and KuCoin’s referral programs. Here’s the step-by-step guide to getting some free crypto in your wallet!</p>



<h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>



<p>For those not familiar with cryptocurrency, it’s a type of digital currency that is both secure and anonymous. While it was first popularized as an alternative to traditional money, there are many other ways you can use cryptocurrency—you can even earn some for free. There are tons of ways to get your hands on some cryptocurrency without spending a cent; here are a f<a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/05/06/how-to-delete-instagram-account-permanently-2022/">ew simple tips for doing so.</a></p>



<h2>Where do you get it?</h2>



<p>One of the easiest ways to get cryptocurrency for free is through faucets. Faucets are websites that give out coins in exchange for doing simple tasks, such as viewing an ad or solving a captcha. They’re easy to find with a quick Google search, and they can be fun when you’re bored or want a little extra spending money.</p>



<h2>What does it mean for YOU?</h2>



<p>Getting free cryptocurrency is easier than you think, as long as you take some simple steps. In order to acquire cryptocurrency, it’s important to note that there are three basic forms: Cryptocurrencies are digital assets designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure transactions and control creation of additional units.<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">you can visit for more info</a></p>



<h2>Why should you invest now?</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are starting to see mainstream adoption, and thanks to them we’re finally seeing an end to unsustainable fiat currency that isn’t backed by anything other than trust. If you want to make sure you can take advantage of this new financial system as soon as possible, there are several simple things you can do now. Once you have a wallet set up and a small amount of cryptocurrency in it, here are four easy ways to get free cryptocurrency through different cryptocurrency faucets</p>



<h2>The easiest ways to invest your crypto</h2>



<p>There are a lot of people out there trying to sell you their courses and advice on how to invest your cryptocurrency. But, if you’re looking for easy ways to invest your crypto without a ton of work, there are some simple things you can do</p>



<h2>Common scams and how to avoid them.</h2>



<p>While cryptocurrencies are often seen as a way to get rich quick, they can also be a dangerous investment vehicle. As with any currency, if you’re not careful and stay informed of scam attempts, you can lose your entire investment. Don’t believe us? Check out our list of common cryptocurrency scams below: Scam #1: Airdrops and Giveaways An airdrop is when a cryptocurrency distributes free tokens or coins to its community members.</p>



<h2>Create your wallet.</h2>



<p>The first step to getting free cryptocurrency is creating a wallet. Wallets are like online bank accounts that allow you to deposit money (also known as crypto tokens) and access it through an online user interface. Don’t worry, they’re pretty easy to create. For example, MyEtherWallet is one of several ethereum wallets available online that don’t require any technical know-how; all you need is your private key and a password.</p>



<h2>Buy some coins.</h2>



<p></p>



<p>First and foremost, you’ll need to purchase cryptocurrency. If you haven’t already purchased some bitcoin, start there—it’s a well-established coin with a lot of trading volume. Once you have your coins, move them into an exchange account (Gemini is our favorite) and trade them for altcoins or tokens such as tronix, Ethereum, or monero.</p>



<h2>Be aware of the risks.</h2>



<p>While cryptocurrency can be a great investment, it’s important to understand that there are risks involved. Newer cryptocurrencies might not have a lot of support from their developers and communities, so you could end up with little or no support if there’s a problem. Also keep in mind that security is always an issue when you start dealing with valuable cryptocurrency, so make sure you take measures to protect your investment.</p>



<h2>Use multiple exchanges.</h2>



<p>The most popular way to purchase cryptocurrency is through Coinbase, but it’s not nearly as flexible as other options. If you want to diversify, look into Binance and KuCoin—they offer competitive rates and typically have far more cryptocurrencies available for trade. Make sure you create an account with them and deposit money before purchasing anything on any exchange. The easiest way to get started with a new exchange is by using my referral link below</p>
