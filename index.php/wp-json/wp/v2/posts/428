The plane and the 239 people on board have never been found, and no one knows what exactly happened to them or where they ended up \u2014 it\u2019s truly aviation\u2019s biggest mystery. Below are five possible theories about what happened to the plane, along with their likelihood and the most compelling evidence (or lack thereof) to support each one.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dekorbiz.com\">for more info visit that website<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Introduction<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 departed from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia en route to Beijing. The plane carried 227 passengers and 12 crew members, who were from more than 14 countries. It flew normally for about an hour and a half before it disappeared from air traffic control radar over Vietnam. When it didn\u2019t land as scheduled in Beijing four hours later, authorities around Asia and then the world launched a search operation that remains ongoing two years later. However, debris has been spotted throughout Southeast Asia since then. Authorities have not confirmed whether any of it is from Flight 370. A Chinese ship detected signals consistent with those emitted by underwater locator beacons attached to aircraft on April 5 and April 8; however, no wreckage was found in either location. In July 2015, a flaperon washed up on Reunion Island off Africa\u2019s east coast. French officials confirmed that it was part of Flight 370 based on unique identifiers like its color and markings. Investigators still don&#8217;t know what happened to Flight 370 or where exactly it crashed into the ocean\u2014if indeed it did crash at all\u2014but they do have some theories based on what they&#8217;ve found so far\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The facts about Malaysia Airlines flight 370<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Malaysia Airlines flight 370 was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Malaysian Airlines between Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport. 2. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, serial number 28420, registration 9M-MRO, is owned by Malaysia Airlines (Malaysia). 3. The first routine contact with air traffic control occurred while on a cruise flight at FL350 (35,000 feet), approximately one hour before the anticipated landing [in Beijing]. There were no distress calls from either <a href=\"http:\/\/mrteck4u.com\/index.php\/2022\/06\/21\/bill-gates\/\">pilot during or after other routine<\/a> communications with air traffic control. 4.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Explanation about Boeing 777<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Boeing 777 is a long-range, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is designed to be operated as a complete airline flight, and often operates on long-haul intercontinental routes between major cities of the world. Along with Airbus&#8217; A330 and A340, it was one of only three types widely used around the world until very recently. The aircraft has two engine types; Rolls Royce Trent 800s for most models and General Electric GE90 for some models (all aircraft). It has been offered in two main variants: -200ER\/300ER (Extended Range) and -300\/400 ER (Extended Range).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Questions asked by everyone on the MH370 accident<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777-200ER flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China? The aircraft disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board and has yet to be found. Several theories have arisen about what happened; some believe it crashed into the sea near Australia, while others think it landed on an unknown island. There&#8217;s even a theory that its fuselage could have been used for target practice by North Korea. And then there are those who don&#8217;t believe there ever was a missing plane in the first place. However, new reports suggest that MH370 may have landed safely and is waiting to be repaired somewhere\u2014leaving behind passengers who were not supposed to survive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion on the MH370 incident<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been more than four years since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board, but still no answers. The Boeing 777 was supposed to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m. on March 8, 2014, but never arrived\u2014and no trace of it has ever been found. Authorities have confirmed that they believe flight 370 crashed into the Indian Ocean; however, what caused that crash remains unknown. Here are some of the explanations on the MH370 incident that you may have heard over and over again\u2014and why experts think these theories just don&#8217;t add up.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In March of 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished from radar shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":429,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false},"categories":[34],"tags":[36],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.5.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Biggest Mystery in Aviation: What Happened to MH370 Flight?
