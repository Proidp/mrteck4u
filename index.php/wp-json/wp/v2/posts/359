How does it work?"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<h2>intro<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The World\u2019s First Flying Car was invented in Slovakia! How does it work? Slovakia has become the latest country to join the race to produce the world\u2019s first flying car, with Aeromobil unveiling the prototype of its model at the Top Marques auto show in Monaco last week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why flying cars are ideal for busy city dwellers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Flying cars have been touted as a potential solution to urban congestion, and as we spend more time in cities, there are many good reasons why flying cars could be an attractive option. The world\u2019s first flying car is set to take off soon\u2014but how does it actually work? And why are flying cars an ideal solution for busy city dwellers? Read on to find out\u2026 As futuristic as they sound, flying cars are already taking off\u2014literally. Slovakian company AeroMobil has just announced that it will launch its first model next year. But what exactly do these vehicles look like? And <a href=\"http:\/\/mrteck4u.com\/index.php\/2022\/06\/21\/worlds-first-flying-car-invented-in-slovakia-how-does-it-work\/\">how do they actually fly?<\/a> Let\u2019s take a closer look at what makes them tick\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Controlling the flying car<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The flying car will be controlled using an advanced version of your mobile phone. The flying car will fly based on its GPS coordinates, but if you want to take a tour around your city or town then all you need to do is turn on geofencing and you can restrict where your flying car can go. Your GPS coordinates are linked with Google Maps so that you always know where you are and where you\u2019re going.f<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dekorbiz.com\">or more info read<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reducing traffic on roads with flying cars<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The two-seater flying car could be used to ease traffic, as there will no longer be any congestion on roads. We can see people switching their old cars for these new vehicles and use them whenever they need to travel long distances. Instead of being stuck in traffic jams or waiting for trains or buses, they can simply fly over using their new cars. This would not only reduce pollution levels but also save a lot of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When will we see flying cars taking off?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound crazy, but flying cars could be a reality soon. Slovak company AeroMobil have revealed their vehicle &#8211; and although there&#8217;s no scheduled release date yet, people are already eagerly anticipating getting behind the wheel. The car is called an &#8216;Aeromobile&#8217; as it can drive on roads like any other car, before being converted into a plane for air travel. The firm say they&#8217;ve been working on it for 20 years and they hope to launch next year. But how will they do that? And what obstacles will they face along the way? We take a look at how AeroMobil plans to change our lives forever\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Safety concerns about the flying car<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before its planned release sometime next year, Slovakian company AeroMobil will likely have to make some adjustments. Namely, one model of their flying car lacks several safety features. For example, there are no airbags for both driver and passenger. This could be an issue with a vehicle that sits low to the ground and is exposed on all sides. Without any kind of protective barrier, even a minor accident could result in serious injury or death. The lack of seat belts may also pose problems; without them, passengers would need to hold onto something very tightly during takeoff and landing\u2014something that might not be possible if they were carrying luggage or needed to brace themselves for turbulence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Does Slovakia have an advantage over others when it comes to inventing the first flying car?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Other countries are scrambling to get their hands on flying cars, but one Central European country may beat them all to it: Slovakia. A couple of weeks ago, Slovakian company AeroMobil unveiled its latest futuristic invention \u2013 the car that can fly. Whether you live in California or Austria, you might be familiar with Uber. It\u2019s an app that lets you book a ride in someone else\u2019s car with just one tap of your smartphone. The company has been testing out self-driving cars for some time now and is even planning to launch a fleet of driverless taxis. But now there\u2019s another contender for the world\u2019s first flying car \u2013 and it comes from Slovakia. Dubbed the world\u2019s first real flying car, AeroMobil 3.0 was revealed at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona last week.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>intro The World\u2019s First Flying Car was invented in Slovakia!
