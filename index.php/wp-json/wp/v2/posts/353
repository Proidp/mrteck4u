It also turned out to be one of the most tragic events in maritime history, when it sank during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City on April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg in the early hours of that morning. More than 1,500 passengers and crew were killed with only 705 surviving the accident, many of them picked up by the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia, which was just a few miles away when the Titanic went down at <a href=\"http:\/\/mrteck4u.com\/index.php\/2022\/06\/21\/worlds-first-flying-car-invented-in-slovakia-how-does-it-work\/\">approximately 2:20 AM local time.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Top 3 things that contributed to the sinking<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The official inquiry into how and why RMS Titanic sank on 15 April 1912 produced a 692-page report but failed to pinpoint exactly what happened in those final hours. Nevertheless, it offers a number of possible causes for its sinking. The following are just three of them. Remember that when it left Southampton it was fully loaded with more than 3,000 tons of coal. When it was fitted out as a luxury liner after leaving Belfast, eight tons more were added \u2013 which would make her top-heavy \u2013 and she also carried water in two 11m-high tanks forward to provide extra ballast aft. If they had ever been used, they would have increased her gross tonnage from 46,328 tons to 49,928.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mrtrickx.com\">for more info visit that website<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why was there only limited damage done to other ships?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were other ships nearby when the Titanic sank, but none sustained major damage. In fact, there was little evidence that any ship in proximity to TITANIC actually collided with her. The immediate answer as to why that happened is simply good luck. If they had been sucked into TITANIC\u2019s vortex, there would have been more damage and it\u2019s likely more people would have died. But why didn\u2019t those near-misses collide with TITANIC? It all comes down to physics. When a massive object like a cruise liner sinks quickly in water, it creates a suction force known as the vacuum effect. This force can be powerful enough to suck even large objects underwater if they are close enough. That explains how RMS Olympic managed to escape TITANIC\u2019s pull; she was too far away for it to reach her hull. But what about other vessels that were closer than Olympic\u2014how did they manage not get pulled under by suction force?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The disappearance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On April 15, 1912, at around 11 pm. ship time, RMS Titanic hit an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later. The great ship had been sailing from Southampton to New York when it struck an iceberg on its starboard side (right side) about 1250 miles away from Newfoundland. Two-thirds of those aboard perished in one of history\u2019s worst maritime disasters. So what happened? Why did Titanic sink so quickly? And why did so many people die that night in April 1912? This is a look at some of these questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The myth of J. Bruce Ismay<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was May 8, 1912, and J. Bruce Ismay had been on board his ship, RMS Titanic, for less than three hours. Since dawn that morning he had been supervising operations in the Belfast shipyard where the Titanic was being fitted out prior to her maiden voyage. She was due to set sail on May 10 and head out into a four-day journey across one of the busiest shipping lanes in Europe before reaching Cherbourg, France, and then onto Southampton by 5 pm on Wednesday 15th May 1912. After five days at sea, she would begin her transatlantic crossing from Southampton to New York which started with an intended stop at Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland on Wednesday 22nd May 1912.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The myth of Thomas Andrews<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Andrews was not a great man. He was not even a good man. Instead, he was what most young men were in 1913, a bit full of himself and eager to make his mark on history. The story that\u2019s told is that he designed an unsinkable ship\u2014the Titanic\u2014and that its sinking remains a mystery to him (he went down with it). But if you take an honest look at what we know about his final days, you\u2019ll find that nothing could be further from reality\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The myth about iceberg warnings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a ship as massive as The Titanic could sink in mere hours, how did its crew fail to spot icebergs and avoid them? Well, it\u2019s not that simple. There are several myths associated with those warnings, so let\u2019s dive right into them. For starters, it was widely believed that when Captain Smith spotted an iceberg around 11 pm on April 14th, he relayed its position to his crew using radio and ordered them to turn left at full speed. That turned out to be incorrect \u2013 there were no working distress calls made from The Titanic that night.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Titanic was the most luxurious passenger liner to ever set sail across the North Atlantic.
