<p>Many people take their health insurance coverage for granted. You wake up every morning, walk to the bathroom, look in the mirror and say hello to your reflection, knowing that if you ever need medical care, you have insurance that will pay for it. But there are several things you should know before purchasing health insurance just to make sure it’s the right decision for you and your family. The good news is there are lots of options out there, so finding the right one doesn’t have to be too difficult.</p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">1) How does my state’s health insurance marketplace work?</mark></strong><br>Each state has a health insurance marketplace, also known as an exchange. These exchanges were created by Obamacare and allow you to easily compare plans based on price, coverage, or both. To shop on your state’s exchange, visit www.healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 for more information and assistance. You can apply for coverage at any time during open enrollment (Oct. 1–Dec. 15), but most people wait until closer to January because it can take up to two weeks after applying before you receive your new plan. Coverage begins Jan. 1 of each year unless otherwise specified in your plan documents—typically March or April of each year. Once you select a plan, complete your application online (or through paper mail if necessary) and submit it so that <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/the-secret-business-model-of-tesla-how-does-tesla-earn-money-elon-musk/">it arrives no later than Dec.</a></p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">2) What type of coverage is best for me?</mark></strong><br>There are two types of health insurance to choose from: individual and group. Individual plans are ideal for self-employed individuals or employees of companies with fewer than 50 employees. They’re also cheaper, as they don’t have any overhead. If you want more comprehensive coverage and/or you want to cover your family, a group plan may be a better option for you. The premiums will be higher but so will your benefits. Group plans typically offer more options when it comes to providers, too. In most cases, an employer pays at least part of your premium; if you decide to buy a policy on your own, expect to pay anywhere from 10% to 100% out-of-pocket. Depending on where you live and how much coverage you need, expect annual costs ranging between $2,000 and $12,000.<a href="http://www.dekorbiz.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">3) What if I don’t have enough money to buy health insurance?</mark></strong><br>We’ve all heard stories about people who have fallen into debt because they haven’t been able to make their health insurance payments, but there are other options for those in between jobs or who simply can’t afford coverage. If you are struggling to pay your bills, don’t panic. There are programs that can help you get on your feet while paying your bills. Contact your state department of social services to see if you qualify for Medicaid and/or food stamps. Your doctor may also be able to direct you toward free clinics in your area where medical care is provided regardless of ability to pay. And lastly, if you live near a college campus, many schools offer subsidized healthcare plans to their students. The catch? You must prove you are a student in order to enroll. (Remember: Anytime someone offers something for free it means someone else is footing the bill.) This isn’t a comprehensive list by any means; however, it should give you some ideas as to what kinds of things might be available depending on your situation. Good luck!</p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">4) How do I know how much coverage I need?</mark></strong><br>No matter your health, there’s a plan that works for you. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean they all cost the same. The deductible is a number you pay out of pocket before insurance kicks in. It can range from $0 to $6,000 or more for an individual plan and $12,000 or more for family coverage—though these numbers will vary depending on what company you use and what state you live in. If you have a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, look for plans with lower deductibles ($1,500–$2,500) and higher maximum out-of-pocket costs ($3,000–$5,000). For preventive care like flu shots and screenings (and birth control), look for plans with no deductibles at all. And if you have dental work? Look into dental insurance as well; it’s often included in comprehensive policies.</p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">5) Can I change my plan during open enrollment or if I experience life events like marriage, divorce, birth, or death?</mark></strong><br>To qualify for a health insurance plan outside of open enrollment, you will likely need to experience a life event such as marriage, divorce, birth or death. There are exceptions that allow you to change plans during regular enrollment if you move states or counties. If your employer offers more than one plan, you can change to another company’s plan at any time during open enrollment. However, you may not be able to change back to your original plan until next year’s open enrollment period. Also, keep in mind that changing from one type of plan to another (e.g., from an HMO to PPO) is treated as a permanent switch and may cause gaps in coverage due to pre-existing conditions unless you have guaranteed issue. You should contact your state Department of Insurance and/or human resources department before making any changes so you know what steps must be taken before switching plans.</p>
