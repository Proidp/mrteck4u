<p></p>



<p>The Titanic was the most luxurious passenger liner to ever set sail across the North Atlantic. It also turned out to be one of the most tragic events in maritime history, when it sank during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City on April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg in the early hours of that morning. More than 1,500 passengers and crew were killed with only 705 surviving the accident, many of them picked up by the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia, which was just a few miles away when the Titanic went down at <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/worlds-first-flying-car-invented-in-slovakia-how-does-it-work/">approximately 2:20 AM local time.</a></p>



<h2>Top 3 things that contributed to the sinking</h2>



<p>The official inquiry into how and why RMS Titanic sank on 15 April 1912 produced a 692-page report but failed to pinpoint exactly what happened in those final hours. Nevertheless, it offers a number of possible causes for its sinking. The following are just three of them. Remember that when it left Southampton it was fully loaded with more than 3,000 tons of coal. When it was fitted out as a luxury liner after leaving Belfast, eight tons more were added – which would make her top-heavy – and she also carried water in two 11m-high tanks forward to provide extra ballast aft. If they had ever been used, they would have increased her gross tonnage from 46,328 tons to 49,928.<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>Why was there only limited damage done to other ships?</h2>



<p>There were other ships nearby when the Titanic sank, but none sustained major damage. In fact, there was little evidence that any ship in proximity to TITANIC actually collided with her. The immediate answer as to why that happened is simply good luck. If they had been sucked into TITANIC’s vortex, there would have been more damage and it’s likely more people would have died. But why didn’t those near-misses collide with TITANIC? It all comes down to physics. When a massive object like a cruise liner sinks quickly in water, it creates a suction force known as the vacuum effect. This force can be powerful enough to suck even large objects underwater if they are close enough. That explains how RMS Olympic managed to escape TITANIC’s pull; she was too far away for it to reach her hull. But what about other vessels that were closer than Olympic—how did they manage not get pulled under by suction force?</p>



<h2>The disappearance</h2>



<p>On April 15, 1912, at around 11 pm. ship time, RMS Titanic hit an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later. The great ship had been sailing from Southampton to New York when it struck an iceberg on its starboard side (right side) about 1250 miles away from Newfoundland. Two-thirds of those aboard perished in one of history’s worst maritime disasters. So what happened? Why did Titanic sink so quickly? And why did so many people die that night in April 1912? This is a look at some of these questions.</p>



<h2>The myth of J. Bruce Ismay</h2>



<p>It was May 8, 1912, and J. Bruce Ismay had been on board his ship, RMS Titanic, for less than three hours. Since dawn that morning he had been supervising operations in the Belfast shipyard where the Titanic was being fitted out prior to her maiden voyage. She was due to set sail on May 10 and head out into a four-day journey across one of the busiest shipping lanes in Europe before reaching Cherbourg, France, and then onto Southampton by 5 pm on Wednesday 15th May 1912. After five days at sea, she would begin her transatlantic crossing from Southampton to New York which started with an intended stop at Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland on Wednesday 22nd May 1912.</p>



<h2>The myth of Thomas Andrews</h2>



<p>Thomas Andrews was not a great man. He was not even a good man. Instead, he was what most young men were in 1913, a bit full of himself and eager to make his mark on history. The story that’s told is that he designed an unsinkable ship—the Titanic—and that its sinking remains a mystery to him (he went down with it). But if you take an honest look at what we know about his final days, you’ll find that nothing could be further from reality…</p>



<h2>The myth about iceberg warnings</h2>



<p>If a ship as massive as The Titanic could sink in mere hours, how did its crew fail to spot icebergs and avoid them? Well, it’s not that simple. There are several myths associated with those warnings, so let’s dive right into them. For starters, it was widely believed that when Captain Smith spotted an iceberg around 11 pm on April 14th, he relayed its position to his crew using radio and ordered them to turn left at full speed. That turned out to be incorrect – there were no working distress calls made from The Titanic that night.</p>

<h2>intro</h2>



<p>Music can be very beneficial and helpful to you, What can music do to help you? when you are listening to it every day, in one way or another. It all depends on the type of music you listen to because there are different types of music and some types can be good for you and others bad for you. When it comes to classical music it&#8217;s been proven that people who listen to classical music on a regular basis tend to live longer because it makes them feel relaxed and calmer than any other type of music would do, in other words, you relax more and your blood pressure stays stable while listening to classical music.</p>



<h2>Music helps with concentration</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s well known that listening to classical or instrumental music for a few minutes a day is one of many scientifically proven ways to improve concentration and focus. Research shows that it works by reducing distractions. The specific type of listening used in these studies is known as passive (as opposed to active) listening, where participants just listen rather than engage with the sounds in any way. In an active-listening study led by LeMoyne College researchers, students listened passively to classical or country music while completing computer tasks; those who listened to classical performed better on subsequent tests than those who listened to country.</p>



<h2>Music helps with your mood</h2>



<p>The rhythm of a song has been proven to affect our heart rate, breathing patterns, and blood pressure. This is called entrainment, and it has positive effects on your overall mood. There’s some evidence that putting on calming music before going to bed may actually improve sleep quality. In one study conducted at Baylor University in Texas, researchers played soft piano music in exam rooms while people had their teeth cleaned or cavities filled. When they returned six months later for a checkup, patients reported feeling less pain and anxiety during procedures than those who hadn’t listened to soothing tunes beforehand. Music helps with the thinking process: Listening helps build memories for what we hear—not just lyrics but also tones and instruments used in songs.</p>



<h2>Music helps with decision making</h2>



<p>Studies suggest that a simple song might be all we need to make better choices and decisions. For example, when people were asked how much they would pay for certain merchandise, more often than not, those who heard a song by their favorite artist said they’d spend more money than those who didn’t. Of course, there are other factors at play, but scientists think that listening to music has an effect on our neural networks; it changes our mood or biases us in some way. Scientists have even made correlations between what songs we listen to (and buy) and how we vote.</p>



<h2>Music makes boring jobs more bearable</h2>



<p>I’m not talking about listening to music while working—although that’s certainly not a bad idea. I mean actually using it as a tool in your everyday life. If you spend most of your day at a desk, try listening to it through headphones. If you tend to listen with earbuds, try switching up your playlist and putting on your headphones so that they stay out of sight. Your coworkers will appreciate it—and even if they don’t, your productivity won’t suffer as much as you think! A study from 2013 found that workers who listened to music were more productive than those who didn’t, but only when their choice of tunes was self-selected. In other words, you should be able to choose what you want to hear without anyone else making suggestions for you. The study also found that people who listened to their own playlists were more productive than those who had no music at all—even if their choices weren’t particularly upbeat or peppy. Just knowing that they could pick whatever song they wanted to be made them feel better about being there and doing what they had to do, which resulted in increased performance overall.<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>

<h2>Music enhances productivity</h2>



<p>Music has also been shown to enhance productivity. A number of studies have found that adding ambient music increases our performance in tasks such as math, reading comprehension, memory recall, and listening skills. When we are working hard and not taking breaks, ambient noise can distract us from our concentration. This is why many work environments don’t allow for background noise; however, research shows that even simple noises like a fan or soft instrumental music can increase productivity and reduce stress. This means that if your job allows it, it’s a good idea to have a radio or some kind of headphones on during work hours so you never feel tempted to break out of your workflow for silly <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/19/get-ready-america-songwriter-carin-leon-is-coming-to-a-city-near-you/">distractions like checking </a>Facebook!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many people take their health insurance coverage for granted. You wake up every morning, walk to the bathroom, look in the mirror and say hello to your reflection, knowing that if you ever need medical care, you have insurance that will pay for it. But there are several things you should know before purchasing health insurance just to make sure it’s the right decision for you and your family. The good news is there are lots of options out there, so finding the right one doesn’t have to be too difficult.</p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">1) How does my state’s health insurance marketplace work?</mark></strong><br>Each state has a health insurance marketplace, also known as an exchange. These exchanges were created by Obamacare and allow you to easily compare plans based on price, coverage, or both. To shop on your state’s exchange, visit www.healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 for more information and assistance. You can apply for coverage at any time during open enrollment (Oct. 1–Dec. 15), but most people wait until closer to January because it can take up to two weeks after applying before you receive your new plan. Coverage begins Jan. 1 of each year unless otherwise specified in your plan documents—typically March or April of each year. Once you select a plan, complete your application online (or through paper mail if necessary) and submit it so that <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/the-secret-business-model-of-tesla-how-does-tesla-earn-money-elon-musk/">it arrives no later than Dec.</a></p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">2) What type of coverage is best for me?</mark></strong><br>There are two types of health insurance to choose from: individual and group. Individual plans are ideal for self-employed individuals or employees of companies with fewer than 50 employees. They’re also cheaper, as they don’t have any overhead. If you want more comprehensive coverage and/or you want to cover your family, a group plan may be a better option for you. The premiums will be higher but so will your benefits. Group plans typically offer more options when it comes to providers, too. In most cases, an employer pays at least part of your premium; if you decide to buy a policy on your own, expect to pay anywhere from 10% to 100% out-of-pocket. Depending on where you live and how much coverage you need, expect annual costs ranging between $2,000 and $12,000.<a href="http://www.dekorbiz.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">3) What if I don’t have enough money to buy health insurance?</mark></strong><br>We’ve all heard stories about people who have fallen into debt because they haven’t been able to make their health insurance payments, but there are other options for those in between jobs or who simply can’t afford coverage. If you are struggling to pay your bills, don’t panic. There are programs that can help you get on your feet while paying your bills. Contact your state department of social services to see if you qualify for Medicaid and/or food stamps. Your doctor may also be able to direct you toward free clinics in your area where medical care is provided regardless of ability to pay. And lastly, if you live near a college campus, many schools offer subsidized healthcare plans to their students. The catch? You must prove you are a student in order to enroll. (Remember: Anytime someone offers something for free it means someone else is footing the bill.) This isn’t a comprehensive list by any means; however, it should give you some ideas as to what kinds of things might be available depending on your situation. Good luck!</p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">4) How do I know how much coverage I need?</mark></strong><br>No matter your health, there’s a plan that works for you. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean they all cost the same. The deductible is a number you pay out of pocket before insurance kicks in. It can range from $0 to $6,000 or more for an individual plan and $12,000 or more for family coverage—though these numbers will vary depending on what company you use and what state you live in. If you have a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, look for plans with lower deductibles ($1,500–$2,500) and higher maximum out-of-pocket costs ($3,000–$5,000). For preventive care like flu shots and screenings (and birth control), look for plans with no deductibles at all. And if you have dental work? Look into dental insurance as well; it’s often included in comprehensive policies.</p>



<p><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">5) Can I change my plan during open enrollment or if I experience life events like marriage, divorce, birth, or death?</mark></strong><br>To qualify for a health insurance plan outside of open enrollment, you will likely need to experience a life event such as marriage, divorce, birth or death. There are exceptions that allow you to change plans during regular enrollment if you move states or counties. If your employer offers more than one plan, you can change to another company’s plan at any time during open enrollment. However, you may not be able to change back to your original plan until next year’s open enrollment period. Also, keep in mind that changing from one type of plan to another (e.g., from an HMO to PPO) is treated as a permanent switch and may cause gaps in coverage due to pre-existing conditions unless you have guaranteed issue. You should contact your state Department of Insurance and/or human resources department before making any changes so you know what steps must be taken before switching plans.</p>
