<h2>intro</h2>



<p>Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals, and protein – all vital nutrients that support optimal health. While dairy products can play an important role in your diet, they’re not all created equal when it comes to nutritional value. To make sure you’re consuming only the best dairy products for health, here are some top picks from each category of dairy products (e.g., milk, butter, cheese).here are The Best Dairy Products for Health: Top Picks for a Healthy Diet</p>



<h2>Processed Cheese</h2>



<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, most processed cheeses have little nutritional value. Although there are some exceptions (like reduced-fat mozzarella), many cheese products are high in saturated fat and sodium and don’t contribute much else to your health. It’s better to stick with minimally processed cheese, like aged cheddar or feta, which offer some benefits in moderation, including calcium and vitamin B12. But if you’re looking for one single best dairy product for health? Plain old whole milk might be it—in addition to providing protein and other nutrients, research shows that full-fat dairy can hel<a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/05/06/how-to-delete-instagram-account-permanently-2022/">p reduce body fat levels.</a></p>



<h2>Cottage Cheese</h2>



<p>Fat-free, low-calorie cottage cheese is an excellent source of protein, with six grams per cup. It’s also rich in calcium and vitamin B12. In addition to these benefits, research suggests that cottage cheese helps lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease by reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and raising HDL (good) cholesterol levels. According to research published in the British Journal of Nutrition, women who consumed one cup of fat-free cottage cheese every day saw an average 10 percent drop in LDL cholesterol and a 5 percent increase in HDL cholesterol after six weeks. As with all dairy products, though, choose low-fat varieties whenever possible—cottage cheese is high in saturated fat even when you opt for low-fat varieties.<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">read more</a></p>



<h2>Frozen Yoghurt</h2>



<p>Even though it’s sometimes called frozen yogurt, true frozen yogurt is very different from the fro-yo sold in American supermarkets. The main difference is that true frozen yogurt is made with live cultures, while most of the fro-yo we find in grocery stores isn’t. Since live cultures are beneficial to our health, try to pick up some frozen yogurt next time you see it at the store—and then add your own fresh berries and granola. It’s far better than any pre-made health food you can buy!</p>



<h2>Plain Greek Yoghurt</h2>



<p>With only five ingredients and very little sugar, plain Greek yogurt is one of the healthiest dairy products you can find. It contains probiotics, which have many potential health benefits; and studies have shown that eating probiotic-rich foods can improve digestion and lower cholesterol levels. If you are watching your weight, opt for non-fat or low-fat Greek yogurt to keep the calorie count down while still getting most of the benefits of regular yogurt. Add in fresh fruit or nuts to add some crunch and extra nutrients.</p>
