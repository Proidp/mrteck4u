<p>What makes English the world&#8217;s most powerful language? Is it the way it sounds? The way it&#8217;s written? The sheer number of people who speak it? Read on to find out!</p>



<h2>Why did the world start speaking English?</h2>



<p>When discussing how to learn English in a simple, effective manner, I often hear people say something like: I’m never going to need it. I live in Brazil; Spanish is enough for me. While you might think that speaking Spanish will allow you to get by just fine, I’d argue that there are a couple of reasons why every single person should be learning English—even if they don’t plan on leaving their home country. The world has become an increasingly interconnected place, and with increased globalization comes increased opportunities. Even if you don’t see yourself ever traveling outside your home country or region, learning English opens up new career paths that would otherwise be closed off to non-English speakers. It also makes doing business easier, as many companies have a worldwide presence and knowing English allows you to work with clients from all over the world.</p>



<h2>What Makes a Language Universal?</h2>



<p>In a world of seven billion people, hundreds of spoken languages, and thousands of dead ones, English is becoming an increasingly important unifier. That may sound obvious—English is one of six official languages at United Nations headquarters in New York City—but it belies some seriously impressive numbers. According to SIL International, an estimated 400 million people speak some form of English as a second language; that’s about 1 in 10 people on Earth. By comparison, China only has an estimated 100 million native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. While that may be great for creating global understanding, it comes with its own problems; deciding how to speak or write proper English can often lead to arguments both within and across countries.</p>



<h2>Native Speakers Today</h2>



<p>How Did It Happen? There are around a billion people who speak English as their first language and roughly 3 billion people who speak it as a second language. These figures make English one of our planet’s most widely-spoken languages; but how did it become so dominant? The history of an international language is fascinating in its own right, but also offers valuable insights into how we communicate today. In particular, what can we learn about globalization from English’s meteoric rise to prominence? And how will English change over time?<br>English is no longer just a Western European language – these days, you’ll find speakers all over Asia, Africa and South America. This geographic spread isn’t surprising when you consider that 500 years ago, there were only 10 million native speakers of English worldwide! However, by 1750 there were 50 million native speakers (and another 50 million non-native ones), which means that by 1850 – just 100 years later – there were 100 million native speakers worldwide.</p>



<h2>How Many People Speak English as their First Language?</h2>



<p>As a result of colonization, there are hundreds of millions of people around the world who speak English as their first language. These nations include countries in North America and across Europe, Australia, and South Africa. There are also many former colonies that still use English to varying degrees, including India, Nigeria, Liberia, Malaysia and Pakistan. In total there are more than a billion people around the world who speak English as their native language.</p>



<h2>What are Some Confusing Points in the History of English?</h2>



<p>England was originally invaded by Germanic tribes who spoke Germanic languages. These were later replaced with Scandinavian invaders, most of whom also spoke Germanic languages, although some were (vaguely) related to Old Norse. Finally, Latin-speaking Normans from France conquered England in 1066 and ruled it for more than 300 years, bringing French with them but also learning English.</p>



<h2>Does Anyone Know What Spanglish Is, Anyway?</h2>



<p>We&#8217;d all like to think we know what words mean, but some are up for debate. Take Spanish. Is it a language? A dialect? An accent? Is it Spanish with an American twang or something else entirely? Spanglish has been evolving in America for more than 400 years, and experts still can&#8217;t agree on what defines it. Here&#8217;s how Spanglish made its way from Spain to our shores. How Much Money Do You Really Make?: Are you making enough money? How much do you really make at your job, after taxes and living expenses? What about your spouse or partner? Find out how much money you make—and how much you&#8217;re likely to make next year—with these simple tools that estimate how changes in income affect your tax burden and take into account government programs such as food stamps. This calculator helps determine whether those free services actually save you money each month.</p>



<h2>So…How Can You Learn To Speak It Like a Native Speaker?</h2>



<p>For those of you who are not native speakers, how can you learn to speak it like a native speaker? The best way is to immerse yourself in an English-speaking environment. This will force you to listen and speak only in English. Every time you speak or interact with another person, you&#8217;ll be exposed to grammar rules and new vocabulary. You&#8217;ll also start picking up on slang words that native speakers use all of the time. It won&#8217;t happen overnight, but if you put in enough hours and practice every day, you should be able to sound just as good as a native speaker within a few months&#8217; time.</p>

<p></p>



<p>It’s hard to believe that 15 years ago, Elon Musk didn’t even have one million dollars to his name. But today, the South African-born serial entrepreneur has a net worth of over 20 billion dollars and the founder of SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and Neuralink. How did he do it? You might be surprised to learn what Musk’s biggest strengths are as an entrepreneur and business leader.</p>



<h2>Tesla</h2>



<p>The idea for Tesla started with a hot tub. While vacationing in Ontario, Canada, at his friend’s cottage, Musk saw that all of his friend’s electricity was coming from a hydroelectric plant built by Nikola Tesla in 1895—the same year as Edison opened his first power plant. Musk wondered why no one had thought of connecting solar panels to batteries before and began researching how he could do it himself. He later told 60 Minutes: I came up with a design for a solar thermal energy system that I thought would be low cost and simple and easy to install…and then I worked on figuring out what would be a good market for it. And I thought, well, we need something where there’s lots of sunlight and not much air pollution.</p>



<h2>SpaceX</h2>



<p>The goal of SpaceX is both ambitious and grounded in reality. If we can send a vehicle into space and return it safely to Earth, then commercial space travel—and ultimately colonization of other planets—becomes possible. And that means taking humanity off planet. It’s a huge ambition but with proper planning and execution, it’s not as crazy as it sounds.</p>



<h2>SolarCity</h2>



<p>When Elon Musk started SolarCity in 2006, he never expected it would become a multi-billion dollar company. Back then, solar energy was just becoming popular, and few people were aware of its benefits or how much it would cost. To figure out how much investment would be needed to launch a massive-scale project, he called his cousin Lyndon Rive (one of SolarCity’s co-founders) and asked him how much money they could raise if they sold their shares at $10 each. The answer? Approximately $80 million—but that’s only if everyone invested.</p>



<h2>Hyperloop</h2>



<p>In 2012, a white paper written by Musk became popular. In it, he described a new form of high-speed transportation that would travel faster than supersonic jets. He called it the fifth mode of transportation &#8212; after planes, trains, cars and boats &#8212; that would carry passengers in pressurized tubes at near-supersonic speeds. Unlike trains or cars, Hyperloop capsules traveling between distant cities wouldn&#8217;t need to stop for hours at a time while they load and unload passengers and cargo. The whole idea came together under an umbrella concept: Hyperloop.</p>



<h2>OpenAI</h2>



<p>The nonprofit artificial intelligence research company OpenAI, launched by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, is hiring. The San Francisco-based team focuses on developing AI that benefits humanity as a whole, instead of helping a specific business or creating weapons. According to its site, Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate a financial return. While few companies have made major strides in improving AIs over time (Google&#8217;s DeepMind being one), OpenAI has some big backers (and brains) behind it.</p>



<h2>Neuralink</h2>



<p>Why the risks are worth it<br>Entrepreneurs often take risks when they start a business. There’s risk in starting a company, whether it’s driven by passion or profit, and for some of us, it may seem like there’s an endless supply of ways our businesses could fail. When these fears loom large, it can be difficult to know if we should push forward with our idea or cut our losses. But what many entrepreneurs forget is that failure is inevitable—there are a lot of things that could go wrong. That said, even those who fail don’t give up on their entrepreneurial dreams: According to Small Business Trends research, 70 percent of people who started businesses felt more confident in their decision after they had failed.</p>



<p><br>Elon Musk has long been fascinated with artificial intelligence and how it might change humanity. He says that AI will not just be a mix of human intelligence and machine intelligence, but it will ultimately take on a life of its own. To that end, he launched Neuralink, which aims to connect your brain directly to digital devices like computers. His belief is that in order for humans and AI to work together we must merge with machines &#8212; if we don&#8217;t do so willingly, he believes our own evolution as a species could force us into it against our will. One way or another, he wants humans and machines to become one.</p>



<h2>The financial services sector has more competition</h2>



<p>Musk could have gotten his degree in physics, joined a big company, and lived happily ever after. But he didn’t. He took a chance on PayPal because he thought there was more opportunity in financial services than rocketry. That might seem obvious now, but back then it was a much riskier idea — so risky that eBay beat him out by acquiring PayPal for $1.5 billion while he was still at school.</p>



<h2>Raising Capital is becoming more difficult</h2>



<p>The good news is that raising capital is getting easier. The bad news? Raising capital is becoming more difficult. A decade ago, it took startups an average of 24 months to raise their first significant round of venture funding. Today, it takes more than three years. While total funding has grown by 30% during that time, rounds have shrunk by 20%. This means you will likely have to work harder and smarter than ever before if you want your business startup business gets funded.</p>



<h2>What he would have done differently</h2>



<p>It’s hard to say with certainty what Musk would have done differently in his younger days, but there’s at least one thing he has mentioned since becoming a billionaire: I was really sad when I realized I wouldn’t become a superhero. When I was a kid, superheroes were my idols. It would be great if we could create some kind of fast transportation system—you know, go anywhere on Earth in under an hour. That would be fantastic. The only way to do that would be to have an orbital vehicle…and re-enter from orbit. These things sound far out, but they’re really not that crazy anymore…the technology is more or less there.</p>

<p></p>



<p>In March of 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished from radar shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing. The plane and the 239 people on board have never been found, and no one knows what exactly happened to them or where they ended up — it’s truly aviation’s biggest mystery. Below are five possible theories about what happened to the plane, along with their likelihood and the most compelling evidence (or lack thereof) to support each one.<a href="http://www.dekorbiz.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 departed from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia en route to Beijing. The plane carried 227 passengers and 12 crew members, who were from more than 14 countries. It flew normally for about an hour and a half before it disappeared from air traffic control radar over Vietnam. When it didn’t land as scheduled in Beijing four hours later, authorities around Asia and then the world launched a search operation that remains ongoing two years later. However, debris has been spotted throughout Southeast Asia since then. Authorities have not confirmed whether any of it is from Flight 370. A Chinese ship detected signals consistent with those emitted by underwater locator beacons attached to aircraft on April 5 and April 8; however, no wreckage was found in either location. In July 2015, a flaperon washed up on Reunion Island off Africa’s east coast. French officials confirmed that it was part of Flight 370 based on unique identifiers like its color and markings. Investigators still don&#8217;t know what happened to Flight 370 or where exactly it crashed into the ocean—if indeed it did crash at all—but they do have some theories based on what they&#8217;ve found so far…</p>



<h2>The facts about Malaysia Airlines flight 370</h2>



<ol><li>Malaysia Airlines flight 370 was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Malaysian Airlines between Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport. 2. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, serial number 28420, registration 9M-MRO, is owned by Malaysia Airlines (Malaysia). 3. The first routine contact with air traffic control occurred while on a cruise flight at FL350 (35,000 feet), approximately one hour before the anticipated landing [in Beijing]. There were no distress calls from either <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/bill-gates/">pilot during or after other routine</a> communications with air traffic control. 4.</li></ol>



<h2>Explanation about Boeing 777</h2>



<p>The Boeing 777 is a long-range, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is designed to be operated as a complete airline flight, and often operates on long-haul intercontinental routes between major cities of the world. Along with Airbus&#8217; A330 and A340, it was one of only three types widely used around the world until very recently. The aircraft has two engine types; Rolls Royce Trent 800s for most models and General Electric GE90 for some models (all aircraft). It has been offered in two main variants: -200ER/300ER (Extended Range) and -300/400 ER (Extended Range).</p>



<h2>Questions asked by everyone on the MH370 accident</h2>



<p>What happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777-200ER flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China? The aircraft disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board and has yet to be found. Several theories have arisen about what happened; some believe it crashed into the sea near Australia, while others think it landed on an unknown island. There&#8217;s even a theory that its fuselage could have been used for target practice by North Korea. And then there are those who don&#8217;t believe there ever was a missing plane in the first place. However, new reports suggest that MH370 may have landed safely and is waiting to be repaired somewhere—leaving behind passengers who were not supposed to survive.</p>



<h2>Conclusion on the MH370 incident</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s been more than four years since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board, but still no answers. The Boeing 777 was supposed to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m. on March 8, 2014, but never arrived—and no trace of it has ever been found. Authorities have confirmed that they believe flight 370 crashed into the Indian Ocean; however, what caused that crash remains unknown. Here are some of the explanations on the MH370 incident that you may have heard over and over again—and why experts think these theories just don&#8217;t add up.</p>

<h2>intro</h2>



<p>Bill Gates&#8217; success and wealth as the richest man in the world are well known, but there&#8217;s one thing that most people don&#8217;t know about his rise to riches and Microsoft&#8217;s growth under his leadership; he quit college to start Microsoft. He was just 18 years old when he made this decision, and he had little money to speak of at the time, so why did he do it? If you&#8217;re interested in how Bill Gates became the richest man in the world, then you need to read on to learn his secret formula for success &#8211; <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/the-top-10-maritime-attorneys-in-houston-you-need-to-know/">it can change your life too!</a></p>



<h2>From rags to riches</h2>



<p>From 1965 to the present day, Microsoft has seen phenomenal growth. It all started with one man: Bill Gates. Little did we know, he had a dark secret that helped him become who he is today. Check out what made him what he is today and how you can apply it to your own life. He says there are three things you need to do if you want to become successful. These are no guarantees but they certainly give us something to think about. He says he never knew where his next meal was coming from or when his next paycheck would be coming in. So here’s his advice for anyone looking for success. Let’s begin…<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</h2>



<p>Not many people know that in 1985, when Bill Gates left Microsoft, he and his wife Melinda created The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. It was a non-profit organization aiming to help children worldwide with improving health and learning. Since then, they have awarded more than $30 billion to various initiatives. What most people don’t know is why they chose to get involved with philanthropy in such a large way. Most billionaires would either give away their money quietly or would set up their own charitable foundations through family members or close friends. But not Bill and Melinda; instead, they decided to give it all away through an entirely separate entity from themselves &#8211; The Gates Foundation. This is where things get interesting…</p>



<h2>Do you have what it takes?</h2>



<p>In August 2010, Forbes declared that Bill Gates was once again, for the seventh consecutive year, the richest man in the world. The magazine also reported that he was worth $59 billion. So you might wonder: What&#8217;s his secret? What does it take to become one of the wealthiest men in modern history? Surely you are aware that only a very small percentage (like 0.001%) of people ever manage to become millionaires at all—and even fewer go on to earn billions. So how did Gates do it? And what can we learn from him? Well, if you want to become one of the wealthiest men in modern history yourself, here is your chance…to discover THE DARK SECRET OF BILL GATES! This is not some kind of joke; I am dead serious! You see, while most gurus like to keep their secrets close and sell them for big bucks over and over again—I have decided to give mine away for free. Just follow my simple instructions below and soon enough you will be able to say: I am Bill Gates!<br>I know what you&#8217;re thinking…what makes me so sure that I can help YOU become as rich as Bill Gates? Well, let me tell you something about myself first.</p>



<h2>Why did he do it?</h2>



<p>By setting aside his ego, by building a team around him, and by admitting mistakes. To become The World&#8217;s Richest Man you need to have 3 things: a clear understanding that there are no limits, being positive in all situations and not being afraid to lose everything you have. When he started Microsoft he was already worth $1 million but risked it all when starting Microsoft with just one product. When they released Windows 1.0 he was almost bankrupt but then came Windows 2.0 and then Windows 3.0 which made them billionaires overnight! He knew that if he wanted to become The World&#8217;s Richest Man, he had to focus on his vision and be confident about it because most people would say it is impossible. His advice for becoming The World&#8217;s Richest Man is Be passionate about what you do. And remember: If your dreams don&#8217;t scare you, they&#8217;re not big enough!</p>



<h2>What is his secret?</h2>



<p>Bill Gates has a secret you need to learn. He, along with countless others, will tell you it is all about hard work and sacrifice. And while that may be true to some extent, there is something more fundamental that is at play here: they took risks and made sacrifices based on calculated actions. What are we talking about? Something as simple as learning when to quit and walk away from something seemingly good in order to accept something better or different down the road. This can apply to people who go back for their second undergraduate degree versus those who start a new business after leaving full-time employment for a startup or established business venture.
