<p>When you delete your Instagram account, it doesn’t really go away permanently. It just gets hidden from public view and you can decide to restore it whenever you want. That said, if you’re really done with Instagram, here’s how to delete your Instagram account permanently so no one can see it ever again…here are How to Delete Your Instagram Account Permanently</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>If you want to delete your Instagram account permanently, there are three different ways you can accomplish that goal. Read on for how to do it! 1) Log in to your Instagram account and click on Settings at the top of your screen. Then scroll down until you see delete my account and click on yes, delete my account and then confirm again by clicking yes, delete my account again. That will be all you need to do if you want to simply deactivate your account rather than actually <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/05/06/how-to-delete-instagram-account-permanently-2022/">deleting it permanently</a>.</p>



<h2>Step #1 Login to your account</h2>



<p>Log into your account through any browser of your choice. Go to Settings under your profile page in the top right corner, and then click on Privacy Settings. Scroll down till you see Deactivate my account option; click on it. Now you will be prompted with a box asking for reasons for deactivating your account; select a reason by clicking on any of them or typing in a new one and clicking next.<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>Step #2 Click on the Settings tab at the top right of your screen</h2>



<p>Select Edit profile, then click on delete my account: Follow on-screen instructions and click Continue: This will take you through a series of steps where you are asked to write a reason for deleting your account. Choose your reason, click continue and confirm that you wish to delete your account by clicking delete: A confirmation message is sent to your email address which you need to follow up with. Once it&#8217;s confirmed that we have received your request successfully, all content will be removed from Instagram and it may take up 2 business days for all content posted before deletion (e.g., likes or comments) to appear as deleted posts on your profile page. If you change your mind at any time after deleting, please let us know by selecting the contact us form below!</p>



<h2>Step #3 Scroll down until you see an option labeled delete my account</h2>



<p>and click that. You’ll be asked to enter your password and once you do, you’ll need to tap on a tiny link that reads DELETE MY ACCOUNT.. . . It may take a couple of minutes for your account page to load again with no information in it after you delete your account, but don’t worry because all of your pictures, videos, and followers will still be there in case you decide to return at some point in time.</p>



<p>Step #4 Click on delete my account and confirm your decision<br>This will permanently delete your account and all of its contents. Once you click on delete my account, there is no turning back. So it is important that you confirm your decision before going ahead with it. However, if you really wish to remove your Instagram account permanently then feel free to follow these steps given below</p>
