<h2>intro</h2>



<p>Bill Gates&#8217; success and wealth as the richest man in the world are well known, but there&#8217;s one thing that most people don&#8217;t know about his rise to riches and Microsoft&#8217;s growth under his leadership; he quit college to start Microsoft. He was just 18 years old when he made this decision, and he had little money to speak of at the time, so why did he do it? If you&#8217;re interested in how Bill Gates became the richest man in the world, then you need to read on to learn his secret formula for success &#8211; <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/the-top-10-maritime-attorneys-in-houston-you-need-to-know/">it can change your life too!</a></p>



<h2>From rags to riches</h2>



<p>From 1965 to the present day, Microsoft has seen phenomenal growth. It all started with one man: Bill Gates. Little did we know, he had a dark secret that helped him become who he is today. Check out what made him what he is today and how you can apply it to your own life. He says there are three things you need to do if you want to become successful. These are no guarantees but they certainly give us something to think about. He says he never knew where his next meal was coming from or when his next paycheck would be coming in. So here’s his advice for anyone looking for success. Let’s begin…<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</h2>



<p>Not many people know that in 1985, when Bill Gates left Microsoft, he and his wife Melinda created The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. It was a non-profit organization aiming to help children worldwide with improving health and learning. Since then, they have awarded more than $30 billion to various initiatives. What most people don’t know is why they chose to get involved with philanthropy in such a large way. Most billionaires would either give away their money quietly or would set up their own charitable foundations through family members or close friends. But not Bill and Melinda; instead, they decided to give it all away through an entirely separate entity from themselves &#8211; The Gates Foundation. This is where things get interesting…</p>



<h2>Do you have what it takes?</h2>



<p>In August 2010, Forbes declared that Bill Gates was once again, for the seventh consecutive year, the richest man in the world. The magazine also reported that he was worth $59 billion. So you might wonder: What&#8217;s his secret? What does it take to become one of the wealthiest men in modern history? Surely you are aware that only a very small percentage (like 0.001%) of people ever manage to become millionaires at all—and even fewer go on to earn billions. So how did Gates do it? And what can we learn from him? Well, if you want to become one of the wealthiest men in modern history yourself, here is your chance…to discover THE DARK SECRET OF BILL GATES! This is not some kind of joke; I am dead serious! You see, while most gurus like to keep their secrets close and sell them for big bucks over and over again—I have decided to give mine away for free. Just follow my simple instructions below and soon enough you will be able to say: I am Bill Gates!<br>I know what you&#8217;re thinking…what makes me so sure that I can help YOU become as rich as Bill Gates? Well, let me tell you something about myself first.</p>



<h2>Why did he do it?</h2>



<p>By setting aside his ego, by building a team around him, and by admitting mistakes. To become The World&#8217;s Richest Man you need to have 3 things: a clear understanding that there are no limits, being positive in all situations and not being afraid to lose everything you have. When he started Microsoft he was already worth $1 million but risked it all when starting Microsoft with just one product. When they released Windows 1.0 he was almost bankrupt but then came Windows 2.0 and then Windows 3.0 which made them billionaires overnight! He knew that if he wanted to become The World&#8217;s Richest Man, he had to focus on his vision and be confident about it because most people would say it is impossible. His advice for becoming The World&#8217;s Richest Man is Be passionate about what you do. And remember: If your dreams don&#8217;t scare you, they&#8217;re not big enough!</p>



<h2>What is his secret?</h2>



<p>Bill Gates has a secret you need to learn. He, along with countless others, will tell you it is all about hard work and sacrifice. And while that may be true to some extent, there is something more fundamental that is at play here: they took risks and made sacrifices based on calculated actions. What are we talking about? Something as simple as learning when to quit and walk away from something seemingly good in order to accept something better or different down the road. This can apply to people who go back for their second undergraduate degree versus those who start a new business after leaving full-time employment for a startup or established business venture. It can also apply to someone like Bill Gates, who left Harvard University early to pursue his dream of starting Microsoft. He was willing to give up his reputation as an honor student and leave behind his friends because he had a vision that would later become one of the largest companies in history. If you want to be successful, then don&#8217;t just take chances—take calculated ones. Learn how by reading below!</p>
