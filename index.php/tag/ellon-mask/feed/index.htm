<p>It’s hard to believe that 15 years ago, Elon Musk didn’t even have one million dollars to his name. But today, the South African-born serial entrepreneur has a net worth of over 20 billion dollars and the founder of SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and Neuralink. How did he do it? You might be surprised to learn what Musk’s biggest strengths are as an entrepreneur and business leader.</p>



<h2>Tesla</h2>



<p>The idea for Tesla started with a hot tub. While vacationing in Ontario, Canada, at his friend’s cottage, Musk saw that all of his friend’s electricity was coming from a hydroelectric plant built by Nikola Tesla in 1895—the same year as Edison opened his first power plant. Musk wondered why no one had thought of connecting solar panels to batteries before and began researching how he could do it himself. He later told 60 Minutes: I came up with a design for a solar thermal energy system that I thought would be low cost and simple and easy to install…and then I worked on figuring out what would be a good market for it. And I thought, well, we need something where there’s lots of sunlight and not much air pollution.</p>



<h2>SpaceX</h2>



<p>The goal of SpaceX is both ambitious and grounded in reality. If we can send a vehicle into space and return it safely to Earth, then commercial space travel—and ultimately colonization of other planets—becomes possible. And that means taking humanity off planet. It’s a huge ambition but with proper planning and execution, it’s not as crazy as it sounds.</p>



<h2>SolarCity</h2>



<p>When Elon Musk started SolarCity in 2006, he never expected it would become a multi-billion dollar company. Back then, solar energy was just becoming popular, and few people were aware of its benefits or how much it would cost. To figure out how much investment would be needed to launch a massive-scale project, he called his cousin Lyndon Rive (one of SolarCity’s co-founders) and asked him how much money they could raise if they sold their shares at $10 each. The answer? Approximately $80 million—but that’s only if everyone invested.</p>



<h2>Hyperloop</h2>



<p>In 2012, a white paper written by Musk became popular. In it, he described a new form of high-speed transportation that would travel faster than supersonic jets. He called it the fifth mode of transportation &#8212; after planes, trains, cars and boats &#8212; that would carry passengers in pressurized tubes at near-supersonic speeds. Unlike trains or cars, Hyperloop capsules traveling between distant cities wouldn&#8217;t need to stop for hours at a time while they load and unload passengers and cargo. The whole idea came together under an umbrella concept: Hyperloop.</p>



<h2>OpenAI</h2>



<p>The nonprofit artificial intelligence research company OpenAI, launched by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, is hiring. The San Francisco-based team focuses on developing AI that benefits humanity as a whole, instead of helping a specific business or creating weapons. According to its site, Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate a financial return. While few companies have made major strides in improving AIs over time (Google&#8217;s DeepMind being one), OpenAI has some big backers (and brains) behind it.</p>



<h2>Neuralink</h2>



<p>Why the risks are worth it<br>Entrepreneurs often take risks when they start a business. There’s risk in starting a company, whether it’s driven by passion or profit, and for some of us, it may seem like there’s an endless supply of ways our businesses could fail. When these fears loom large, it can be difficult to know if we should push forward with our idea or cut our losses. But what many entrepreneurs forget is that failure is inevitable—there are a lot of things that could go wrong. That said, even those who fail don’t give up on their entrepreneurial dreams: According to Small Business Trends research, 70 percent of people who started businesses felt more confident in their decision after they had failed.</p>



<p><br>Elon Musk has long been fascinated with artificial intelligence and how it might change humanity. He says that AI will not just be a mix of human intelligence and machine intelligence, but it will ultimately take on a life of its own. To that end, he launched Neuralink, which aims to connect your brain directly to digital devices like computers. His belief is that in order for humans and AI to work together we must merge with machines &#8212; if we don&#8217;t do so willingly, he believes our own evolution as a species could force us into it against our will. One way or another, he wants humans and machines to become one.</p>



<h2>The financial services sector has more competition</h2>



<p>Musk could have gotten his degree in physics, joined a big company, and lived happily ever after. But he didn’t. He took a chance on PayPal because he thought there was more opportunity in financial services than rocketry. That might seem obvious now, but back then it was a much riskier idea — so risky that eBay beat him out by acquiring PayPal for $1.5 billion while he was still at school.</p>



<h2>Raising Capital is becoming more difficult</h2>



<p>The good news is that raising capital is getting easier. The bad news? Raising capital is becoming more difficult. A decade ago, it took startups an average of 24 months to raise their first significant round of venture funding. Today, it takes more than three years. While total funding has grown by 30% during that time, rounds have shrunk by 20%. This means you will likely have to work harder and smarter than ever before if you want your business startup business gets funded.</p>



<h2>What he would have done differently</h2>



<p>It’s hard to say with certainty what Musk would have done differently in his younger days, but there’s at least one thing he has mentioned since becoming a billionaire: I was really sad when I realized I wouldn’t become a superhero. When I was a kid, superheroes were my idols. It would be great if we could create some kind of fast transportation system—you know, go anywhere on Earth in under an hour. That would be fantastic. The only way to do that would be to have an orbital vehicle…and re-enter from orbit. These things sound far out, but they’re really not that crazy anymore…the technology is more or less there.</p>
