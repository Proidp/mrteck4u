<p>Social media has grown in popularity dramatically over the past decade, but how does it affect our brains and well-being? A new study suggests that the addictiveness of social media may be due to its effects on dopamine, which controls the brain’s reward and pleasure centers. This has huge implications not only on social media use but also on other addictions that target the same areas of the brain. Take this into consideration when you’re wondering why you can’t stop checking Facebook even though you know it makes you <a href="http://mrteck4u.com/index.php/2022/06/21/worlds-first-flying-car-invented-in-slovakia-how-does-it-work/">feel bad about yourself!</a></p>



<h2>The science behind addiction</h2>



<p>Neuroscience has shown that addiction is actually a change in brain chemistry—and not simply a behavioral problem. Simply put, addiction hijacks our brains, compelling us to seek out certain experiences and ignore consequences. Scientists have pinpointed two parts of our brain involved in substance abuse: The limbic system and frontal cortex. The limbic system dictates our emotions and pleasure-reward responses; it makes us crave for certain experiences and gives us pleasure when we engage in them. Meanwhile, the frontal cortex allows us to make good decisions by filtering what’s good from what’s bad—to be rational, logical thinkers.<a href="http://www.mrtrickx.com">for more info visit that website</a></p>



<h2>9 Signs You Are Addicted To Social Media</h2>



<p>You check social media first thing in the morning. When it’s time for you to stop using social media, you feel restless and uncomfortable until you start using it again. You spend much more time on social media than originally intended. You like certain types of content on social media more than others, and if there is no content that suits your taste, you feel agitated or uncomfortable. You have repeatedly tried to reduce your usage of or quit using social media without success.</p>



<h2>Tips To Break The Habit</h2>



<p>If you’re concerned about how much time you spend on social media, we’ve got a few tips to help you break your bad habits and form healthy ones. But first, ask yourself why you use social media so much. What are you getting out of it? Do other areas of your life feel lacking because of it? If so, we recommend talking to a therapist or counselor who can help facilitate conversation about your social media use and its effects on relationships with friends and family members.</p>



<h2>Plugging back into reality</h2>



<p>People who use social media several times a day can become addicted, just like drug addicts. So what is it about our brains that makes us vulnerable to these addictions? The brain’s reward system plays an important role in addiction and compulsive behavior. When we do something pleasurable—whether it’s eating chocolate or using Facebook—our brain releases dopamine, which helps control feelings of pleasure and motivation. The more we repeat an activity (eating chocolate or checking Facebook), the more dopamine gets released and attaches itself to neurons in our brain’s reward system, creating a strong desire for more of that experience.</p>



<h2>Infographic on stats of social media use/addiction</h2>



<p>The scary thing about Facebook is how much people use it. The average user spends almost an hour on Facebook every day (Ventura, 2011). Studies have also shown that people check their Facebook statuses up to 14 times a day (Ventura, 2011). When you think about how many hours in a day and multiply that by how many times someone checks their status, you can see why addiction is a problem. I think everyone at least knows one person who has become obsessed with checking their status.</p>



<p>6 Tips on Using Your Phone Less<br>According to a 2011 report from The Nielsen Company, more than half of Americans own a smartphone and check it regularly throughout their day. That’s 3 billion texts, 400 million tweets, 100 million photos, and 4 million hours of video uploaded each month. For many people, social media use has become an addiction that can be hard to break.</p>
