<p>What makes English the world&#8217;s most powerful language? Is it the way it sounds? The way it&#8217;s written? The sheer number of people who speak it? Read on to find out!</p>



<h2>Why did the world start speaking English?</h2>



<p>When discussing how to learn English in a simple, effective manner, I often hear people say something like: I’m never going to need it. I live in Brazil; Spanish is enough for me. While you might think that speaking Spanish will allow you to get by just fine, I’d argue that there are a couple of reasons why every single person should be learning English—even if they don’t plan on leaving their home country. The world has become an increasingly interconnected place, and with increased globalization comes increased opportunities. Even if you don’t see yourself ever traveling outside your home country or region, learning English opens up new career paths that would otherwise be closed off to non-English speakers. It also makes doing business easier, as many companies have a worldwide presence and knowing English allows you to work with clients from all over the world.</p>



<h2>What Makes a Language Universal?</h2>



<p>In a world of seven billion people, hundreds of spoken languages, and thousands of dead ones, English is becoming an increasingly important unifier. That may sound obvious—English is one of six official languages at United Nations headquarters in New York City—but it belies some seriously impressive numbers. According to SIL International, an estimated 400 million people speak some form of English as a second language; that’s about 1 in 10 people on Earth. By comparison, China only has an estimated 100 million native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. While that may be great for creating global understanding, it comes with its own problems; deciding how to speak or write proper English can often lead to arguments both within and across countries.</p>



<h2>Native Speakers Today</h2>



<p>How Did It Happen? There are around a billion people who speak English as their first language and roughly 3 billion people who speak it as a second language. These figures make English one of our planet’s most widely-spoken languages; but how did it become so dominant? The history of an international language is fascinating in its own right, but also offers valuable insights into how we communicate today. In particular, what can we learn about globalization from English’s meteoric rise to prominence? And how will English change over time?<br>English is no longer just a Western European language – these days, you’ll find speakers all over Asia, Africa and South America. This geographic spread isn’t surprising when you consider that 500 years ago, there were only 10 million native speakers of English worldwide! However, by 1750 there were 50 million native speakers (and another 50 million non-native ones), which means that by 1850 – just 100 years later – there were 100 million native speakers worldwide.</p>



<h2>How Many People Speak English as their First Language?</h2>



<p>As a result of colonization, there are hundreds of millions of people around the world who speak English as their first language. These nations include countries in North America and across Europe, Australia, and South Africa. There are also many former colonies that still use English to varying degrees, including India, Nigeria, Liberia, Malaysia and Pakistan. In total there are more than a billion people around the world who speak English as their native language.</p>



<h2>What are Some Confusing Points in the History of English?</h2>



<p>England was originally invaded by Germanic tribes who spoke Germanic languages. These were later replaced with Scandinavian invaders, most of whom also spoke Germanic languages, although some were (vaguely) related to Old Norse. Finally, Latin-speaking Normans from France conquered England in 1066 and ruled it for more than 300 years, bringing French with them but also learning English.</p>



<h2>Does Anyone Know What Spanglish Is, Anyway?</h2>



<p>We&#8217;d all like to think we know what words mean, but some are up for debate. Take Spanish. Is it a language? A dialect? An accent? Is it Spanish with an American twang or something else entirely? Spanglish has been evolving in America for more than 400 years, and experts still can&#8217;t agree on what defines it. Here&#8217;s how Spanglish made its way from Spain to our shores. How Much Money Do You Really Make?: Are you making enough money? How much do you really make at your job, after taxes and living expenses? What about your spouse or partner? Find out how much money you make—and how much you&#8217;re likely to make next year—with these simple tools that estimate how changes in income affect your tax burden and take into account government programs such as food stamps. This calculator helps determine whether those free services actually save you money each month.</p>



<h2>So…How Can You Learn To Speak It Like a Native Speaker?</h2>



<p>For those of you who are not native speakers, how can you learn to speak it like a native speaker? The best way is to immerse yourself in an English-speaking environment. This will force you to listen and speak only in English. Every time you speak or interact with another person, you&#8217;ll be exposed to grammar rules and new vocabulary. You&#8217;ll also start picking up on slang words that native speakers use all of the time. It won&#8217;t happen overnight, but if you put in enough hours and practice every day, you should be able to sound just as good as a native speaker within a few months&#8217; time.</p>
